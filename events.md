# Events

The gallery will be set up to host various types of events and exhibitions. Through the collaboration with artists, brands, and artisans we will organize themed exhibitions and auctions. The atmosphere created by the Black Dove screens will also allow for workshops, labs, and school visits to offer teaching and networking opportunities. There will be no shortage of musical events and private events.\
