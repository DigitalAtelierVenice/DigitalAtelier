# NFT and artworks resale

The Gallery will regularly hold Exhibitions and sales of NFTs and artworks from the private collection of Digital Atelier and its featured artists. Promotion of the Solana ecosystem and the collections of Affiliate Partners selected by Digital Atelier will also be sold. We also intend to collaborate with top-tier Venetian craftsmen to convert physical artworks into NFTs and sell them through the blockchain. The gallery will organize on-site and online auctions and raffles, giving life to real launches of new NFT collections.
