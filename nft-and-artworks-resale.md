# NFT and artworks resale

Exhibition and sale of NFTs and artworks from the private collection of Digital Atelier and its featured artists. Promotion of the Solana ecosystem and the collections of the partner leaders selected by Digital Atelier. We also intend to collaborate with high-level Venetian craftsmanship to convert physical artworks into NFTs and sell them through the blockchain. The gallery will organize on-site and online auctions and raffles, giving life to real launches of new NFT collections.
