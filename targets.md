# Targets

Creating the first digital art gallery in Venice will offer a unique experience in a city already rich with art history.&#x20;

This business will attract new users to the Solana ecosystem, involving tourists, students, and locals.&#x20;

We will showcase exhibits, sell artwork and NFTs by selected artists, collaborate with renowned collections as well as local artisans.

We offer a space for digital art through "Black Dove" smart screens using blockchain technology.

Ultimately, we target expanding the gallery to other cities to support the global development of digital art and NFTs.
