# Vision

Digital Atelier is the ideal meeting point for artists, collectors, and those who want to approach the world of digital art and Web3. The project aims to create a prominent digital art gallery in the city of Venice, a physical space where visitors can experience the web3, learning and contributing to the growth and development of Solana technology and blockchain.
