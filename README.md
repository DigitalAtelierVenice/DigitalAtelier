# Digital Atelier Pass

"DIGITAL ATELIER" is the first collection launched by the gallery. It consists of 5,000 unique 3D pieces, minted on the Solana blockchain. The goal of the collection is to create a passionate art community actively participating in the birth of the Venice gallery. This means not only raising funds to facilitate the start of the business, but also making the connection between Web3 and the art world  in a futuristic space open to the public.

The launch price and date will be announced later.
